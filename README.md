# Calm Learning Hub (Autism Learning)

## Overview
Calm Learning Hub is an applied artificial intelligence system designed to support
accessible and structured learning experiences for individuals with autism and
sensory sensitivities. The project focuses on reducing cognitive overload, improving
clarity, and enabling adaptive learning support through AI-assisted content delivery.

The system is implemented as a functional prototype and is actively maintained for
iterative enhancement and expansion.

## Purpose and Problem Statement
Many individuals on the autism spectrum face challenges with traditional learning
environments due to sensory overload, lack of personalization, and inconsistent
instructional support. These challenges can limit educational accessibility and
learning outcomes.

Calm Learning Hub addresses this problem by providing a structured, AI-assisted
learning interface designed to prioritize clarity, predictability, and adaptability,
supporting inclusive and accessible education.

## System Description
The system uses artificial intelligence techniques to:
- Present structured and simplified learning content
- Adapt content delivery based on user interaction patterns
- Reduce sensory complexity and cognitive load
- Support consistency and predictability in learning workflows

The system relies on user-provided interactions and publicly available educational
content. No sensitive personal data is collected or stored.

## Current Status
- Deployment Status: Deployed prototype
- Development Stage: Active and iterative
- Availability: Public-facing demonstration instance

## Implementation Highlights
- Emphasis on accessibility and user-centered design
- Modular architecture for future expansion
- Clear separation between content logic and interface
- Designed for scalability and maintainability

## Roadmap
Planned enhancements, scalability objectives, and long-term impact goals are outlined
in the accompanying ROADMAP.md file.

## Alignment with Public Interest
Calm Learning Hub supports public-interest objectives by:
- Improving accessibility in education
- Supporting inclusive learning environments
- Enhancing educational equity through technology
- Enabling scalable assistive learning tools
