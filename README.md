# Calm Learning Hub (Autism Learning)

## Overview
Calm Learning Hub is an applied artificial intelligence system designed to support
accessible and structured learning experiences for individuals with autism and
sensory sensitivities. The system focuses on reducing cognitive overload, improving
clarity, and enabling consistent, sensory-friendly educational interactions for
students, educators, and parents.

The platform is implemented as a functional prototype and actively maintained for
iterative improvement.

## Purpose and Problem Statement
Many individuals on the autism spectrum face challenges with traditional learning
environments due to sensory overload, lack of personalization, and inconsistent
instructional support. These challenges can limit educational accessibility and
learning outcomes.

Calm Learning Hub addresses this problem by providing a structured, AI-assisted
learning interface designed to prioritize clarity, predictability, and adaptability,
supporting inclusive and accessible education.

## System Description
The system supports three primary user roles: students, teachers, and parents. Each
role is provided with functionality tailored to promote inclusive learning,
transparent progress tracking, and effective communication.

### Current Student Features
- Student account creation and authentication
- Ability to add and connect with assigned teachers
- View lessons assigned by teachers
- Read assigned lessons in a sensory-friendly, low-cognitive-load format
- Ask questions to an assigned teacher or parent
- Mark lessons as complete so that teachers and parents can view progress

### Current Teacher Features
- Teacher account creation and authentication
- Ability to add and manage students
- Assign lessons by converting standard instructional material into sensory-friendly
  content using AI assistance
- Respond to student questions and requests
- Revise sensory-friendly lesson content using AI-based adjustments
- Monitor progress and completion status of assigned students

### Current Parent Features
- Parent account creation and authentication
- Ability to add and manage student accounts
- View student lesson progress and completion status
- Review student questions or requests for help
- Address identified learning challenges and provide support

The system relies on user-provided interactions and educational content and does not
collect sensitive personal or medical data.

## Current Status
- Deployment Status: Functional prototype
- Development Stage: Active and iterative
- Availability: Public-facing demonstration instance

## Implementation Highlights
- Emphasis on accessibility and user-centered design
- Modular system architecture for future expansion
- Clear separation between content processing, user roles, and interface logic
- Designed for scalability and maintainability

## Roadmap
Planned enhancements and long-term objectives are documented in the accompanying
ROADMAP.md file.

## Alignment with Public Interest
Calm Learning Hub supports public-interest objectives by:
- Improving accessibility in education
- Supporting inclusive and equitable learning environments
- Enhancing transparency between students, teachers, and parents
- Enabling scalable assistive educational tools through AI
